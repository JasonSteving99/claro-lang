# Builtin Collections

Claro also rounds out its builtin types with a small set of convenient collection types that allow you to manipulate
many values using a single variable. These are provided as builtins for your convenience, but their implementations have
been hand selected to cover the majority of your general purpose programming use cases.

## Ad-Hoc Declarations

Unlike many other languages (e.g. Java/C++/etc.) that require a formal declaration of any type before it can be 
instantiated, Claro's builtin collections can all be simply instantiated at will as if the type already exists. For 
example, any struct-like collection of named fields in Java would first require the declaration of a class, and 
potentially the declaration of other things like a constructor, hashCode() and equals() implementations. In Claro, you
simply skip all the boilerplate.

For example, the following Claro procedure declares a `struct {row: int, col: int}` inline as the function's return type
and doesn't need any top-level declaration of that type before it's used:

{{EX1}}

## Mutability

All of Claro's builtin collection types come in either a **mutable** or **immutable** variant - by default, Claro will
assume that any collection literals are intended to be __immutable__.

The following example demonstrates initialization of a **mutable** list of integers:
{{EX3}}

## Mutability Annotations are Shallow

Claro's mutability annotations are shallow by design so that you maintain fine-grained control over creating arbitrarily
complex nested data structures that mix mutability and immutability as needed. The following examples demonstrate 
different combinations of nested mutability annotations:

This example demonstrates a mutable list whose elements are immutable lists.
{{EX4}}

This example demonstrates an immutable list whose elements are mutable lists.
{{EX5}}

## Data Race Safety via Deep Immutability

<div class="warning">
This builtin support for mutability annotations allows Claro to enforce some very strong safety guarantees in concurrent 
contexts, so this is about more than just providing a convenient library of data types.
</div>

See the [Concurrency](../../concurrency.md) section in this book for more details on how Claro will statically leverage 
knowledge of whether a type is deeply immutable or not to prevent unsafe data races.
