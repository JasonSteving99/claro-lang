# Welcome to Claro!

## Claro is a statically typed JVM language that provides a well-lit path to building simple, highly concurrent, and scalable applications.

## Dependency Management Done Right
---
Claro was designed with modern build tooling in mind:
- Swap any dependency without changing a single line of source code
- Runtime "Dependency Injection" frameworks are a thing of the past
- First class Module system
## Fearless Concurrency
---
Developed by a Xoogler taking inspiration from years of hands-on development experience with Google-internal backend web
frameworks, Claro moves well beyond async/await. Claro’s declarative, DAG-based structured concurrency model is the 
first of its kind in a programming language - statically guaranteeing that programs are:
- Non-blocking
- Data-race free
- Deadlock free
- Optimally scheduled
- Scaleable by default
## Data Oriented
---
- Strict separation between data and functionality
- Mutability tracked at the type system level
- Extremely flexible built in algebraic data types
- Model arbitrary data structures with zero boilerplate
## Unapologetically Practical
---
- Bi-directional type inference
- Robust standard library
- Builtin external package manager
- Build time metaprogramming
## Designed to Scale with You
---
- Incremental compilation out of the box
- Code reuse made simple
- Develop codebases of any size without devolving into a spaghetti labyrinth
## Actively In Development
---

**Claro is in active development and is not yet ready for production use**. While Claro has been in active development 
for more than 3 years, its design and implementation has been done entirely by its single maintainer, 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonsteving/" target="_blank">Jason Steving</a> - while the foundation has been 
laid, contributions are welcome! Anyone with interest is actively encouraged to reach out and get involved!
