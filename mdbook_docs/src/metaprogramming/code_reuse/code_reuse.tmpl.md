# (Literal) Code Reuse

<div class="warning">

While other languages offer various different complex language features that can be used **_in order to enable code 
reuse_**, Claro takes the approach that you should just skip the complicated Type gymnastics and go straight to 
_**literally reusing source code**_. 

It will take a bit of conceptual groundwork (unlearning long-held assumptions) to understand Claro's approach here, but
in exchange, you'll be given some powerful new ways to think about "what" a program is.

Probably the most fundamental idea that you'll need to internalize to fully understand Claro's larger design in a deep
way is the relationship that a file containing Claro source code actually has with the final resulting program. This is
a subtle point. It's very possible to write a good amount of Claro code without noticing anything unusual in this
regard. Rather than starting with a detailed explanation, we'll start with some examples.

First, notice that
