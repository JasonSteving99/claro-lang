# In addition to the standard `while` and `for` looping constructs, you also have access to a `repeat` control flow
# construct that simplifies a common pattern that's annoying to implement with `while`/`for`. This is absolutely just
# syntax sugar.

print("Hello, world!");
repeat(10) {
  print("Hello, again!");
}

repeat(-999) {
  print("The body will never run if the repeat count <= 0.");
