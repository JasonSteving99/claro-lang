...and currently completely unrelated to the Claro project itself.

Probably there's a future where a rewrite happens that takes advantage of ANTLR for generating an AST that can be
visited using ANTLR's builtin tree walker mechanism. This would allow Claro to move away from its currently terrible use
of inheritance and move to a data centric approach. Potentially an initial step towards bootstrapping in Claro could be
done using this mechanism as well. We'll see, for now no concrete plans, only vague ideas.
