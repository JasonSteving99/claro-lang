# Welcome to Claro!

Charo is a statically compiled JVM language whose goal is first and foremost to provide you with the tools for reasoning
about program design and construction using a very clear and direct mental model - data flowing through a systems of
steps where new data may be produced, and existing data may be updated by the system at each step. This stated mental
model is intentionally simple. Where it may be vague, I hope to add clarity in the rest of these intro docs.

Where other languages tend to mostly fall into the "Object-Oriented" (Java, Python, etc) paradigm, or the "Functional
Programming" (Haskell, Elm, Roc, etc) paradigm, Claro eschews both of these extremes and lands somewhere more
closely resembling a mix of procedural and declarative programming. Claro aims to be easily digestible to programmers
coming from other paradigms by actually striving to add as few totally novel features as possible - only adding net-new
ideas where they can be easily understandable to any user with moderate effort and only after the net-new idea has
proven to provide some substantial, and observable benefit in the real world. Claro is not an esoteric language
to be marvelled at by experts, or language geeks (like myself). Claro is a practical language whose mission is to help
make writing readable, extensible, and performant programs significantly easier than one would achieve using existing
languages and tools. Rather than depend heavily on layers of frameworks to achieve things like dependency injection,
safe concurrency and more, Claro gives you powerful capabilities out of the box.

Learning Claro will involve a bit of unlearning of previous language principles, but will leave you with a single,
well-lit path.
